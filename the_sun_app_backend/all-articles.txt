    "title": "Solar storms of May 2024",
    "description": "Solar storms of May 2024 were some of the most powerful in recent history.\n These storms caused significant disruptions in Earth's magnetic field, affecting satellite systems, communications, and even producing auroras visible far from the poles. The storms were the most intense since 1989, and space weather agencies closely monitored their impact on radiation belts and technological infrastructure.",

    "prompt": "I want a summary of this article, make it simple to understand for an adult audience, \n
            tell me the main events and make me a list of possible effects for humans \n
            such as lost of signal for communications of satelite affection.",
    "summary": "In May 2024, powerful solar storms took place, including solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) from May 10–13.\n 
    \tThese storms led to a significant geomagnetic event, the strongest since 1989. \n
    This event caused auroras to be visible much farther south than usual, such as in Greece. \n
    The geomagnetic storm disrupted communications, affecting radio signals, GPS, and even satellite systems like GOES-16 and Starlink.
    \n
    Potential Effects on Humans:\n
    \n
    Loss of satellite-based communications
    GPS disruptions
    Radio signal interference
    Possible power grid instability in some regions.
